# AUPPIST APP
## Purpose
The primary goal of this mobile application is to enhance the way food and drinks are ordered in AUPP’s canteen. Being actual students in AUPP, we often encounter the problem of long waiting lines whenever we want to order things at the canteen, especially during peak hours or lunch time. Furthermore, there are times when someone else takes our food without properly checking if it is theirs. These specific problems encouraged us to design this app, with the needs of students and staffs in mind, to streamline the ordering process, eliminate long waiting times, and foster convenience. By digitizing the ordering experience, our app promotes efficiency, reduces human errors, and ensures a seamless interaction between customers/students and canteen operators. 

## Functionality
AUPPIST serves as an intuitive and user-friendly platform for ordering food and beverages. In includes the following key functionalities:
-	Menu Browsing: Users can access a well-categorized digital menu for food(Bistro) and drinks(Two Beans), complete with item descriptions, prices, and images.
